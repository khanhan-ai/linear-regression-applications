# Application of Linear Regression in Economics and Healthcare – Group Project

This is a group machine learning project applying linear regression techniques to predict and analyze outcomes in both medical and economic contexts. The project is part of our university coursework for the course **Optimization Models for Economics**.

## Group Members

- Võ Trần Khánh An – Building Linear Models & Assumption Checks  
  Developed multiple linear regression models in R. Conducted assumption checks (e.g., linearity, normality) and created insightful visualizations to interpret the results.

- Lê Thị Hồng Đang – Literature Review on Linear Regression & Presentation Design  
  Conducted a thorough review of linear regression theory. Designed and structured the presentation slides to effectively communicate the project’s methodology and findings.

- Lâm Gia Hân – Background Research in Healthcare & Report Writing  
  Researched real-world use cases of linear regression in healthcare settings. Contributed to writing the final project report, with a focus on medical-related insights.

- Võ Thị Thu Hồng – Background Research in Economics & Report Writing  
  Explored the applications of linear regression in economic analysis. Assisted in writing the report, particularly in economic-related sections and interpretation.

## Methodology
The project followed these steps:

1. **Domain Research in Economics and Healthcare** – We began by studying real-world applications of linear regression in both economic and medical contexts. This helped us understand how regression models are used to make predictions and interpret relationships in fields such as public health (e.g., diabetes prediction) and macroeconomics (e.g., income and employment analysis).

2. **Model Building** – We applied simple and multiple linear regression models using R to both datasets.

3. **Assumption Checking** – We verified key assumptions of linear regression, including linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, and absence of multicollinearity.

4. **Interpretation** – We analyzed the estimated coefficients, p-values, and overall model fit to derive meaningful insights from the data.

5. **Reporting** – We documented the methodology, results, and conclusions in a structured and clear format for presentation and submission.

## Dataset
- **Walmart Weekly Sales Dataset**  
  [Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset]  
  This dataset contains historical sales data for Walmart stores. It includes features such as temperature, holiday indicators, and CPI. We used this dataset to investigate how different factors influence retail sales, making it a practical case for linear regression in economics.

- **Body Fat Prediction Dataset**  
  [Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset]  
  This dataset provides body composition measurements including weight, BMI, and various body part circumferences. We applied linear regression to predict body fat percentage based on these variables, demonstrating a healthcare-related use case.
